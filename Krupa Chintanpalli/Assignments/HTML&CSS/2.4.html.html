<h1>Patric Young</h1>
<p>I am a lecturer in the Stanford Computer Science Department. Before coming to Stanford, I spent two years as a<br>
programmer at Taligent (now part of IBM). At Taligent, I worked on Places for Project Teams, a groupware product<br> 
designed to improve communication and coordination within small project teams. I was fortunate to work with the Places for<br>
Project Teams product throughout an entire software lifecycleâ€”from initial product conception through the actual product<br> 
launch.
</p>
<p>I have a Ph.D. from the University of California, Irvine, where I specialized in Software Engineering. My dissertation was on<br>
process support for software engineering teams. I also have a master's degree from Irvine, with a specialization in Artificial<br> 
Intelligence, and bachelor's degrees in Computer Science and Electrical Engineering.
</p>
<p>At Irvine, I taught Introduction to Software Engineering, a sophomore core class, and Software Processes, a graduate<br> 
seminar. I also worked as a peer academic advisor, a freshman orientation advisor, and served on leadership for campus<br> 
chapters of both Habitat for Humanity and InterVarsity Christian Fellowship.

    <li><u><a href="#">Freestyle Figure Skating</a></u></li>
    <li>Keeping Molly, my <a href="#">Cairn Terrier,</a> out of trouble.</li>
