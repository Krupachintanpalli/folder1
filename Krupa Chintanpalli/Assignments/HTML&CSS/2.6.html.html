<pre><h5 style="color:blue;">  My name is Yuki Furunga from Japan. I have 6 people in my family. Traveling to other countries each year<br>
has become our family custom since I was born. We start to travel overseas when the year I was born. We <br>
went to America, Australia, France and England, China, Korea and Taiwan. My mom especially loves traveling.<br>
She is always talking about traveling when the time comes closer to a vacation. I heard from my mom, my dad<br> 
used to not like to go traveling but my mom took him every year. He began to like traveling since then.<br></h5>
</pre></p>
<p><pre><h5 style="color:yellow;">Now I have grown up. Our family lives separately. My parents and grandmother are living in Japan where I was<br>
born. I have two older brothers who are living in China for studies and I am living in USA also for studies. But of<br>
course we will go to travel this year too. We probably go to Germany in this summer vacation where the place my<br> 
mom wants to go.<br></h5>

<h5 style="color:yellow;">As for me wherever I am traveling with my family, it is always much fun and meaningful since we have less<br> 
time together.</pre></p></h5></center>
